# Hero Level Classifier Challenge

## What Should Be Used

- Variables
- Operators
- Loops
- Decision Structures

## Objective
In this challenge, you will create a variable to store the name and the amount of experience (XP) of a hero. Then, use a decision structure to present one of the following messages:

- If XP is less than 1,000 = Iron
- If XP is between 1,001 and 2,000 = Bronze
- If XP is between 2,001 and 5,000 = Silver
- If XP is between 6,001 and 7,000 = Gold
- If XP is between 7,001 and 8,000 = Platinum
- If XP is between 8,001 and 9,000 = Ascendant
- If XP is between 9,001 and 10,000 = Immortal
- If XP is greater than or equal to 10,001 = Radiant

## Output

In the end, the following message should be displayed:

**"The Hero named {name} is at the {level} level"**

## Conclusion

This challenge provided a valuable opportunity to apply fundamental programming concepts, including the use of variables, operators, loops, and decision structures. By classifying the level of a hero based on the amount of experience (XP) accumulated, you strengthened your logical and implementation skills in JavaScript.
